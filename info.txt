description = [h1]Customizable rocket boosters[/h1]Click on a dynamic object and attach a booster to it or just click on the ground to put one upright. Rocket gimble attempts to maintain the orientation when attached, so if you put flat on the ground then it will try to stay upright. attaching the engine to something sideways will attempty to maintain that direction through gimbal action. Other keys/options on the bottom left of the screen in game.[h2]Reducing lag[/h2]To reduce lag, open the options with the (O) key and and turn the flame density down or off.[h2]What is this anyway?[/h2]This mod allows you to adjust the thruster strength and uses a gimbal control to maintain attitude. A pressure field is simulated to give more realistic fire effects. Press (F11) to see the pressure field in the engine bell. This was really just an experiment that was too fun not to share with the community, so don't judge this toy too harshly. Hope you have fun!
